# slaygpt 💅
Literally just a ChatGPT wrapper, but slay. (Okay, I made this just to try out how AI works with a React Native and Expo setup, and it's pretty good!)

### To try it yourself
Clone the repo and add a `.env` file with your OpenAI API key:

```
EXPO_PUBLIC_OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-key-here>
```
